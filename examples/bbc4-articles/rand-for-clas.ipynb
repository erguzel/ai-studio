      "b'Dogged Federer claims Dubai crown\\n\\nWorld number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.\\n\\nTop seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week\\'s final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him all the way. \"I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,\" Federer said.\\n\\n\"That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.\" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. \"I didn\\'t start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,\" he said. \"After those first three games it was no match at all. I don\\'t know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.\" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. \"I had a chance in the third, and for me it\\'s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. \"It\\'s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I\\'m up there and belong with top-class players.\"\\n'\n",

      "b'Renault boss hails \\'great year\\'\\n\\nStrong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.\\n\\nFrance\\'s second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; \\xc2\\xa32.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm.\\n\\nRenault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on the previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.\\n\\nIn total, sales outside western Europe - Renault\\'s core market - rose 16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later this year.\\n\\nRenault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was \"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will benefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the roll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected operating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" the company said in a statement.\\n'\n",
